  </p>
  <h2>Common provisions</h2>
  <h3>No Waiver</h3>
  <p>

    cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information
    in accordance with applicable law. Additionally, the Service might not be
    available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such as
    “force majeure” (eg. labor actions, infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts

    time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these
    changes.<br />
     Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User for the
    future. The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance
    of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they
    must stop using the Service. Failure to accept the revised Terms, may
    entitle either party to terminate the Agreement. The applicable previous
    version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The
    User can obtain any previous version from the Owner. If required by
    applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by which the modified Terms
    will enter into force.

    contact information stated in this document.
  </p>

  <h3>Severability</h3>
  <p>

    unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way,
    an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the
    void, invalid or unenforceable parts. In case of failure to do so, the void,
    invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable
    statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
    Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility
    to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the
    entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the
    Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered
    into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid,
    or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an
    unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.
